title: "Maybe Next Time"
description: "<em>moments that he could perhaps have called his in some other time</em>"
---

A lone car sped past, the trunk lid rattling and its tail lights flickering, on the road skimming the edge of town - a long line of cracked pavement traversed solely by those whose destinations lay beneath the horizon. 

Long strides paced alongside the road, Travis walked slowly, the first of two figures drawn onto a canvas of muted oranges and reds, with hands buried in his pockets and gaze locked onto the man in front of him. 

He kept the distance between them to the length of the other’s silhouette, distorted and stretched out to the tip of his worn dress shoes. Yet despite confronting the wind, notes of a forgotten melody lingered as their maker walked on and, in response, Travis’ smile was slight - the sight a ripple in an ocean stilled by solitude.  

It had been more than a decade, but Walt sauntered down old shortcuts and through empty alleys like he did at sixteen, with an easy confidence that kept his eyes forward, his back straight, and his pace steady. 

Hours spent chasing shadows into throngs of people waiting for the sun to set and into rundown buildings emptied of a vigour they exploited, the two of them claimed the town theirs - words a careless debt to be settled by youth. 

Yet now the flap of a disappearing black overcoat was the only thing guiding Travis in the narrow streets, lain criss-cross on top of one another like strings in balls of yarn. The thick fabric fanned out behind him, Walt walked a line only he could see, humming softly to words only he remembered, while Travis wordlessly looked on, a hand raised half-heartedly to his eyes to shield against the harsh rays of sun beating down. 

---

Eventually, Walt sat down heavily on the grass and Travis watched him cross his arms over his knees, gesturing towards the water as he spoke. 

“See - the sun isn't even close to the horizon yet. We could’ve gone back to Jim’s. Grab a couple beers, maybe call up some people from before.”

He threw his head back to look at Travis, who averted his gaze downwards to the small stain on his left shoe. A hand reached out to swat at his leg and, after a moment, Travis obediently flicked his chin slightly upwards. 

Walt lowered his voice as, below them, waves crashed on the beach and above seagulls cried. 

“Hey, smile, won't you?”

Something small tugged at the corner of Walt’s own lips and a little of the hardness in his expression drained. He reached up to tug on Travis’ sleeve, and the latter bent down, awkwardly folding his legs underneath him to sit on the damp grass. 

“So Travis, you got your wish. We’re here, just as you requested. What now?" 

“We wait.”

“Yeah - no shit. How long?“

“About half an hour.”

Walt nodded, eyes once more focusing on something down below. Travis followed his gaze to a child wearing polka dots and an older boy a few feet away from her, wrestling a beach umbrella. The girl looked small, arms wrapped around a stuffed rabbit, while the brother yelled and threw the umbrella to the wind, huffing as it floated calmly down onto the sand.

Suddenly, a loosely made fist lightly bumped his chest and Travis turned to see Walt’s grin, stretched wider in the time he wasn't looking. With pale skin and shadows cast by edges that made him look sharper in the day, he had a permanent frown etched into his features that made it seem as if he had been born into the world bored. 

Yet when the next breeze came, strands of curled hair were swept up, the lines relaxed, and Travis could see remnants of something from long ago that made his stomach clench. 

“No problem, I’ve waited longer haven’t I?”

Travis looked away. 

For a while, the two of them sat in silence an arm’s length from the jagged edge of town where waves crashed into land while, behind them, the streets were slowly going to sleep. There had been a sign lodged in the dirt where Walt was sitting, leaning against the fence that served as the last barrier, but Travis knew - when it came down to it - that it failed to serve its purpose.

Beside him, Walt fell backwards onto his back. Hands clasped behind his neck, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath in. Held it. Then let it out in a deep sigh that seemed to grow in volume. Eyelid opening a crack, he reached over and tapped Travis’ left wrist once, twice.

“You got a tattoo?”

“Yeah.”

Walt sat up, eyes fixated on the small print. He grabbed Travis’ hand with both of his, tugging his arm closer and angling it, and Travis winced from the coldness of skin on his but kept watching as Walt murmured the encircling words.

“The morning will come even without me in it.”

He let go and Travis automatically wrapped his own fingers where Walt’s had rested, his own heat numbing the cold feeling.

“The hell does that mean?” 

Travis shrugged. “I heard someone say it once.”

“And so you got it inked? No way - the Travis who hid whenever the nurse came to do shots?”

“I don’t remember that.”

“But I do. So what? Some line from a TV show? The parting words of an ex?”

Travis rolled his eyes but remained silent. 

“Hey.”

As a lone seagull soared over them with a cry, the girl in polka dots squealed as her brother swung her around and around, throwing her arms out and tossing her head back, while the boy tripped over his own feet but never faltered in a smile that reached his tired eyes.

“You okay?”

Walt shuffled over a little, one hand on Travis’ arm, his knee nudging against his thigh, his face coming in close enough that Travis could smell their lunch on his breath - leftover pepperoni pizza, taken out from between beer and more beer in the fridge and microwaved to lukewarm. 

Walt had assured him that it wasn’t more than a day old, and he had reluctantly swallowed down half a slice in camaraderie. Engulfed by the folds of Jim’s old couch, it had been cramped - two men seated side by side in front of the even smaller TV - but Travis felt he had forgotten what comfort meant until that moment. 

Then, with a grunt, Walt had suddenly shifted his weight onto Travis’ right arm as he reached over to the pizza box, and he had watched - his mind lagging behind reality - as Walt’s profile hovered inches in front of him, the cheekbones jaunty in the dark, brows furrowed in irritation, and the jawbone a line traceable by more than just shadows. 

_Shit, what did he ask?_

“Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine.”

“Sure?”

“Of course.”

“I mean - “

Walt leaned in closer and the hand came up to a rest on top of Travis’ shoulder, as the latter tried not to grimace.

“It’s just - you’re different from what I imagined.”

“...How so?”

“I don’t know. Just different.”

Walt rocked backwards onto his heels, his expression unchanging. Travis stared back, his stony expression tinged with a hint of confusion.

For a while, none of them spoke. Then Walt sighed once more, reaching up to fiddle with the top button of his collar and shove his tie deeper into his shirt pocket. Bowing his head, his long fingers raked through his hair, centimetres longer than Travis remembered it, but then his bangs came back to fall in front of his face and Travis felt sorry, sorry though he couldn’t explain it. 

“Remember when we were younger and we spent every afternoon during the summer right here?" 

Walt waved in front of him, hand sweeping the length of the beach, and Travis nodded. 

“You hated swimming and would run screaming whenever the waves came in, and I thought it was the funniest thing, you being scared. So I'd laugh. Laugh and laugh, then chase you around with a bucket of water, and laugh some more.”

Walt glanced at Travis, grinning.

“It was easy to mess with you, because you were so damn easy to read. Just one look at your face and it was like I had this fucking superpower. One where only I knew what you would do next. One where only I knew the real you.”

Walt shuffled his weight to the other leg and stumbled a little, grabbing Travis’ knee. Travis felt fingernails dig into his skin through the thick black fabric, but automatically reached out a hand to grab Walt firmly by the shoulder to help him get his balance.

“Trav, I was so damn happy you were my friend.”

His voice lowered, but the sound of it seemed to echo when Walt spoke again, his eyes never leaving Travis. 

“So what happened?”

“My parents - "

“I know what happened to your parents. For fuck’s sake, I was there. Restaurant booths, the rooftop, closed movie theatres, the train station - anywhere but your place, that was the rule. First there were a couple of us,but then you got sad and it was just me, following you into empty places where you sat in corners and cried.”

Travis winced and shot a sore look at Walt, who waved it off.

“Look, you know what I’m talking about. And I know you know.”

As the sun continued to sink beneath the water, its descent marked by a glistening trail in the water that stretched towards them, Travis watched a smiling woman slowly make her way down the beach, arms held wide as the girl ran towards her. Stepping on her small footprints, the boy lagged behind, head bowed, and Walt’s words tumbled out, coming from somewhere distant.  

“Travis, I get it. What happened to your brother was shitty… to tell you the truth, I was surprised you didn’t leave sooner. But for weeks - hell, months - I couldn’t stop wondering.”

The boy suddenly stopped and bent down. Squinting, Travis saw that it was the stuffed rabbit that he was picking up, sand falling back into the beach, its small body distorted by the boy’s grip. 

“Why didn’t you say goodbye?” 

Travis didn’t respond, and after a while Walt pushed himself up. Brushing off his pants, he shoved his hands deep into his pockets and set off down the dirt trail that led down from the cliff, kicking aside the tiny rocks scattered in his path. 

Over his shoulder, he mumbled a comment about how the view would be better on the beach, and Travis watched him go, the right side of his shirt untucked and pieces of grass stuck onto the seat of his pants.

And it would have been so easy. 

Just one word and Walt could be the one to pause time, slowing the world to a standstill. An ugly look on his face with the deepening frown, he would spin around on his left heel, tie flapping in the wind, hair whipped around in unflattering directions. And he would wait. Framed against the sun, he would look back, unwavering, and the two of them would be trapped in the moment. 

Travis, heart locking onto something irrevocable. 

Walt, who would know everything the moment he glimpses the former’s face. 

But then it would pass, the seconds speeding up again to a steady tick, and only one of them would move on as before. Eyes rolling, shirt sleeves pushed back up to the elbow, back turning to him - and it’s then that reality would hit and calloused fingers seeking him retract, the light in answering eyes extinguishes, and the words stay caught in his throat.

Travis squeezed his eyes shut, so tightly that opening them again was a punishment from the sun, the sole observer, and he sighed. 

---

After a while, he slowly stood up to follow the sulking figure towards the beach, keeping his eyes downwards to watch his step. 

Eventually he caught up, his legs giving him a certain advantage in the descent, but he stayed behind Walt on the path until the ground flattened out and each step sunk millimetres into the sand. Wordlessly, the two walked westbound for a while, past a stuffed rabbit sitting underneath an umbrella, until all that faced the water was a deserted road and several stores scattered along its length and Walt finally came to a stop.

“So how much longer?”

“Soon.”

Travis folded his legs underneath him and sat a few feet away, propping himself up with his arms.

For a long while, they just watched the waves. 

It was curious, the passing of time. 

It sunk the sun lower in the sky, swept the clock’s hands around and around, pushed people day by day to old age. Walt - who spent summers shirtless and stayed out too late, while claiming loud dominance over his waking hours - now wore suits and glanced every now and then at a shining watch on his left wrist. He had a car he drove everywhere with dents in four places, a love of Elvis Presley that needed no explanation, three shirts he wore in rotation, and a conviction that leftover pizza was good for all three meals of the day, especially when his fiancee was overseas and he had already gotten sick of his specialty, grilled cheese.

Travis, on the other hand, was starting to get back pains. 

They were getting old - too old to have regrets, to hold on to the past. And so after a while he spoke. 

“I thought about it.”

When Walt didn’t respond, Travis looked over at him, lying down with his eyes closed, chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm. Turning his gaze downwards, Travis sifted absentmindedly through the sand, watching the grains slide through his fingers only to disappear indistinguishable into the expanse.

“A week before I left, I had bought a one-way ticket on the train, packed all my belongings into a bag, and prepared myself to say goodbye. My mother wasn’t speaking, my father handed me his wallet and told me to take what I needed. So you were the only one left.”

Travis heard a shuffling sound beside him, but kept talking, lips moving mechanically.

“Yet the week that followed - it seemed like everyone already knew. The way they looked at me, spoke to me like it was the last time. And then I thought to myself… why bother? You’d protest, maybe even start crying. You’d fight for me to stay and then you’d beg me to let you come with. So that’s all it came down to, really.”

He waited for Walt to say something but there was nothing. Leaning backwards, he stared out at the water and kept his voice steady.

“I was just a coward.”

Behind them, someone rode past on their bike, singing loudly off-key to a song that Travis struggled to recognize. Piecing the notes and broken lyrics together, he realized it was a song that his niece was fond of belting in the shower. Smiling a little, it took awhile for him to realize that Walt had picked up the tune and was humming it softly. Then Walt cut himself off and spoke. 

“Okay, but that I knew.”

“Huh?”

“Travis, from the moment I saw you squeal like a girl when a tiny wave came floundering in, I had a pretty good feeling about what you were and weren’t. Remember the first time we met?”

Walt didn’t wait for a response.

“Well, I know for a fact you don’t, because you were drunk off your ass and bawling your eyes out on my shoulder in broad daylight. Two months later, I transferred into the same high school, shoved my way into your gang of idiots, and spent the next couple years at your side, keeping a promise you didn’t even remember making.”  

He paused to glance at his watch, and Travis felt his heart lurch.

“You changing was after your brother jumped, when you stopped wearing your heart on your sleeve and I didn't know what you were thinking anymore. You never looked anyone in the eyes, you barely said more than a few words at a time. Fuck, remember when I found you at the beach up to your thighs in water until the sun went down? You being a coward was nothing new - you not being you…“ 

Walt gave a short laugh.

“Now that was something.”

By then, the sun had sunk far below the horizon, dragging the colour with it, and stars sprinkled themselves across the canvas of black that stretched for miles upwards from the edge where water met sky.

“Trav, it’s fine. We don’t have to talk about it anymore. After all, you’re here now, right? Made your return to this crappy place, when barely anyone remembers your name. I thought Jim was fucking with me when he said you were coming back and hung up. Didn’t know what to do really when I saw you holding that bag of potatoes in the grocery store, asking in this deep voice whether it was really half price.” 

Walt grinned.

“We can go back to how it was. When it was just you and me. Back when you weren’t so damn numb and it was like we had all the time in the fucking world. When are you leaving? In a couple weeks? Days?”

“Tomorrow.”

The smile fell almost as quickly as it first appeared, but Walt collected himself, rolling his eyes.

“Should have known. Just can’t sit still, can you? Well, guess that last part was too good to be true anyways. After all, it's been forever. Can't count on things always being the same.”

Suddenly, Walt paused, before shooting an incredulous look at Travis, who remained motionless.

“Fuck, I almost forgot. We spent your seventeenth birthday here, didn’t we? Lay down right about where we are now and talked about the future. Big plans we had - not that they counted for shit, though. And now look at us. You about to get that big promotion, me about to get married. Honestly, when Cora suggested it, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. I mean, can you really imagine it - me settling down?” 

Walt was quiet for a moment, and when he spoke again his voice was softer. 

“But you know, she was right. We’re getting old. Sooner or later, loneliness will get the better of us - and what the hell is there to do when we lift our heads, glance all around us, but there's no one left? Might as well bring a brat or two into the world, duty bound to at least pay the cremation fee.”  

“Walt.”

“Yeah?" 

“You love her?" 

Walt smiled, and Travis looked away. 

“I mean, I guess. She bakes a mean lasagna, earns more in a week than I do in two, and she's stuck by me for - hell, ever since you've been off doing your own thing. Cora - Cora’s amazing, and I've always thought she was too good for me, but tell her that and I’ll fucking come after you.”

Walt broke off and picked up the song from before, raspy notes trailing one by one from between soft lips. 

“So when's it happening?”

Walt hummed in thought. 

“Don't know - we didn't really set a date. Maybe next month. I'll call you up though, let you know the moment we decide, then if you promise you can come I’ll make you the best man. How about it?" 

Suddenly, his eyes flickered with curiosity. 

“Hey, what about you? Got anyone special?" 

Travis hesitated, then smiled softly. 

Through his mind flitted a dozen faces, but most of them were all blurred. In the dark, it was nearly impossible to observe any in great detail and for years Travis had never been too concerned with staying until morning to find out if any of them were the one. 

Yet in the past few months, there had been a crooked smile and eyes transparent enough to see beyond a quiet man, who crept underneath cold blankets to cradle a lonely heart and give the warm feelings a name, who whispered okay when Travis asked if he could have a little more time. 

“Yeah.”

"Really? Shit, you going to introduce me to them someday or what?”

Travis didn't say a word as Walt kept talking, his voice growing wistful. He had turned away so that Travis could only see the side of his face, the small scar etched near his ear distracting Travis from his words. It hadn't been there before, or at least it never appeared in his memories - the ones that had come to him in darkness when the loneliness those first nights apart had been too much. Walt had too many angles, giving him a particularly aggressive look that was amplified in darkness by unwelcome shadows. It was this that had been Travis’ definition of pretty for so many years - an unblemished replica, all smooth skin and pale lines. Yet there was a mole next to Walt’s right eye, a small one that hid in the crinkle lines that appeared whenever he smiled. 

Smile lines acquired through the years, left over from the moments that creased and engraved them there. Moments foreign to him that belonged to this life. 

Moments that he could perhaps have called his in some other time.

“I’m going to head back.”

Walt glanced at his watch with some surprise, furrowing his brows. Then he nodded, standing up as well.

“Sounds good - get some sleep, don’t want to miss your flight.”

Travis smiled slightly, looking down, when he was pulled into an embrace, arms encircling his shoulders and squeezing firmly. 

“Travis.”

“Yeah?”

“I’m glad you’re doing okay now.”

After a moment, he buried his face into Walt’s shoulder and breathed out, hand coming up to rest on his shoulder.

---

Walking away, it wasn’t until he returned to the road that Travis looked back.

On the beach, Walt was sitting back on the sand, knees pulled in, and chin lifted to gaze back up at the sky. A passerby would have thought it a lonely sight, but Travis had seen the expression on Walt’s face in the moonlight enough times to know the truth.

When Walt had his fill of the stars and moon, he would push himself up, brush the sand off of his coat. Looking at his watch, he would shove his hands in his pockets, humming softly, as he turned his back to the water and returned to the road. 

He would follow the line, the trail that wind back to where he came into town and through the streets and alleyways, until he reached the small apartment with its broken doorbell and its neat rows of mailboxes. 

Taking the stairs, he would huff his way up to the third floor and, fumbling for his keys, he would take the first left, open the door, step into a dimly lit hallway, as a brunette with eyes just as bright and a smile just as wide would poke her head in from the living room and close her eyes as he pulls her into his arms and softly calls her name.

Deep, ebony eyes widening when he says it out loud, knows that he’s decided on what he wants for this lifetime. Arms encircling his neck, mouth hovering on top of his, calling his name quietly, loving him just as easily. 
Travis glanced at the moon, smiling softly. 

Then he turned and walked back down the road, whistling the notes to a song he would forget once the morning comes.
